# Overview
I joined the research team as they were almost done with their first of three papers/aims. Existing files were provided by an exiting colleague, who did the bulk (honestly, pretty much all) of the work to get the data, analyses, and output running. 

Credits to https://github.com/eriliawu/tacobell - look there for more information about what each file entails and the file states that I inherited. Contributions to this repository are mainly updates to the original code, unless specified otherwise. New files will be detailed in the following sections (which is empty, for now).
